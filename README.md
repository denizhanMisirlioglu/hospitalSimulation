# hospitalSimulation

This C project models a hospital system using semaphores to ensure synchronization and coordination between multiple processes.

Semaphores are an essential tool for coordinating access to shared resources in operating systems.
They provide a way for processes and threads to communicate with each other and ensure that critical sections of code are executed in a mutually exclusive manner.

In a multi-process or multi-threaded environment, it is possible for multiple processes/threads to access the same resource simultaneously, leading to data inconsistency or even program crashes. Semaphores allow developers to define critical sections of code and ensure that only one process/thread can access the resource at a time.
